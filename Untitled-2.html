    <p>What would I do without your smart mouth?<br>
    Drawing me in and you kicking me out<br>
    Got my head spinning, no kidding<br>
    I can’t pin you down</p>
    <p>What’s going on in that beautiful mind?<br>
    I'm on your magical mystery ride<br>
    And I'm so dizzy, don’t know what hit me<br>
    But I’ll be alright</p>
    <p>My head’s under water<br>
    But I'm breathing fine<br>
    You’re crazy and I'm out of my mind</p>
    <p>‘Cause all of me<br>
    Loves all of you<br>
    Love your curves and all your edges<br>
    All your perfect imperfections</p>
    <p>Give your all to me<br>
    I’ll give my all to you<br>
    You’re my end and my beginning<br>
    Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
    ‘Cause I give you all of me<br>
    And you give me all of you, oh-oh</p>
    <p>How many times do I have to tell you?<br>
    Even when you’re crying, you’re beautiful too<br>
    The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood<br>
    You’re my downfall, you’re my muse<br>
    My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues<br>
    I can’t stop singing, it’s ringing<br>
    In my head for you</p>
    <p>My head’s under water<br>
    But I'm breathing fine<br>
    You’re crazy and I'm out of my mind</p>
    <p>‘Cause all of me<br>
    Loves all of you<br>
    Love your curves and all your edges<br>
    All your perfect imperfections</p>
    <p>Give your all to me<br>
    I’ll give my all to you<br>
    You’re my end and my beginning<br>
    Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
    ‘Cause I give you all of me<br>
    And you give me all of you, oh-oh<br>
    Give me all of you, oh</p>
    <p>Cards on the table<br>
    We’re both showing hearts<br>
    Risking it all, though it’s hard</p>
    <p>‘Cause all of me<br>
    Loves all of you<br>
    Love your curves and all your edges<br>
    All your perfect imperfections</p>
    <p>Give your all to me<br>
    I’ll give my all to you<br>
    You’re my end and my beginning<br>
    Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
    ‘Cause I give you all of me<br>
    And you give me all of you</p>
    <p>I give you all of me<br>
    And you give me all of you, oh<br><br></p>
